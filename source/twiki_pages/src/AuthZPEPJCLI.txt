---+!! Argus: PEP Java Client: Command Line
%TOC%

---+ Command Line Interface
The PEP-J library contains a basic command line utility that is useful for sending test requests to the PEP daemon.

The command line client, =bin/testreq.sh=, takes a single parameter, the path (absolute or relative) path to a client configuration file.  This client will create an empty request and then run any configured PIPs in order to populate it.  The [[AuthZPEPPIP#Static_Attributes_PIP][Static Attribute PIP]] is very useful for creating custom requests with which to test.
