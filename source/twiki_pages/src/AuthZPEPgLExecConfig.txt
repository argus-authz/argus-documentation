---+!! Argus: gLExec with LCMAPS C PEP Plug-in: Configuration

%TOC%



---+ Manual Configuration

To configure gLExec to use the LCMAPS C PEP plug-in, you'll need to know the PEPd endpoint information, have gLExec, LCAS, LCMAPS and the required plug-ins installed, know which type of resource you are installing it on (typically a Worker Node at the moment of this page's creation) and what type of action is to be authorized (typically for gLExec that is 'execute-now' or maybe 'queue' in the future).



---++ gLExec Configuration file and its restrictions

The gLExec configuration file describes how the gLExec executable must do its work. There are strict rules about the location and permissions set on the gLExec configuration file.

   1. The gLExec configuration file MUST be located on the file system at the location specified at the software build time. This is known to be a very strict rule, but serves the purpose to prevent several file hijacking attacks.
   1. The default gLite shipped version of gLExec will use the file path ==/opt/glite/etc/glexec.conf==
   1. The default VDT shipped version of gLExec will use the file path ==/etc/glexec.conf==
   1. The complete path MUST be *root* owned.
   1. The *glexec.conf* file MUST be *root* owned
   1. The file permissions on the glexec.conf must not exceed *0644* ==(-rw-r--r--)==. They can not be lower then *0440* ==(-r--r-----)==.
   1. It is preferred to set the permissions with *0640* ==(-rw-r-----)== or 0440 ==(-r--r-----)== owned by ==root:root==.


---+++ Workable example gLExec Configuration file

As the gLExec configuration file describes how the gLExec executable must do its work, there are a lot of settings available to be able to fulfill various operationally different requirement of sites. Here is a brief list of options that the gLExec configuration file covers and a complete example of such configuration file:

   * Write to a file or syslog
   * Describes the loglevel for all the logfiles
   * Dictates what kind of input and output file locking must be used (for concurrent scenarios)
   * Whitelists which individual account (for admins) or pool of accounts (production/pilot job submitter pools) is able to access and use gLExec.
   * Declare the initialization vectors for both LCAS and LCMAPS

Here is a workable example of the gLExec configuration file located at ==/opt/glite/etc/glexec.conf==:
<verbatim>
#
#  Glexec (Generic wLCG)
#
[glexec]
log_destination              = syslog
#log_destination              = file
#log_file                     = /var/log/glexec/glexec.log
log_level                    = 1

linger                       = yes
silent_logging               = no
user_white_list              = .atlasprod,.lhcbprod,okoeroo,msalle

user_identity_switch_by      = lcmaps

prohibit_exec_via_symlink    = no
pedantic_security_checks     = no

# You can use fcntl, flock or none
input_lock_mechanism         = flock
target_lock_mechanism        = flock

lcas_db_file                 = /opt/glite/etc/lcas/lcas-glexec.db
lcas_log_file                = /var/log/glexec/lcas_lcmaps.log
lcas_debug_level             = 0
lcas_log_level               = 0

lcmaps_db_file               = /opt/glite/etc/lcmaps/lcmaps-glexec.db
#lcmaps_get_account_policy    = pep_c_posix
#lcmaps_get_account_policy    = scas_posix
lcmaps_log_file              = /var/log/glexec/lcas_lcmaps.log
lcmaps_debug_level           = 0
lcmaps_log_level             = 0
</verbatim>



---++ The LCAS configuration file

In the Argus deployment scenario (similar to the SCAS deployment scenario) the LCAS framework is redundant. In future releases of gLExec the LCAS framework can be switched off and in a later stage complete be removed from the system. For that, a little rework in gLExec is required. This will be announced publicly and also written here.

The easiest solution is to configure the ==userban== LCAS plug-in to look at an empty file. The file must exist and by default should be located at the path ==/opt/glite/etc/lcas/ban_users.db==.


---+++ Workable example LCAS Configuration file
Here is a workable example of the LCAS configuration, conforming the glexec.conf example, located at ==/opt/glite/etc/lcas/lcas-glexec.db==:

#AnchorLCASConf
<verbatim>
# LCAS policy file/plugin definition
# Written by: Oscar Koeroo - okoeroo * at * nikhef * dot * nl
pluginname=lcas_userban.mod,pluginargs=ban_users.db 
</verbatim>




---++ The LCMAPS configuration file

The gLExec, and also SCAS and the lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface, form a front for LCMAPS which abstracts the method and techniques used to procure an account.

We'll dive into the Argus scenario in detail with the LCMAPS C PEP Plug-in, it configuration options and what do setup around it to let it work properly.



---+++ LCMAPS C PEP Plug-in Configuration Options

This describes a list of options for to be passed on to the LCMAPS C PEP Plug-in via the LCMAPS configuration file.
