---+ Authorization Service: INI Configuration File Syntax
%TOC%

---++ Description
The authorization service uses standard INI files for most of its configuration.  INI files are basically key/value property files with the additional concept of grouping or sections in order to provide some scoping mechanisms to the properties.

---++ File Syntax
An INI file contains three basic types of information; comments, sections, and properties.

A comment is a single line starting with the characters '#' (hash) or ';' (semicolon).  It is not interpreted by the parser. The following example gives an INI file with just a comment in it.
<verbatim>
# Start of INI file
</verbatim>

A section is always declared between '[' and ']' characters.  The string betwixt those characters are the section name.  Section names should only include alphanumeric characters plus '.' (period), '_' (underscore), and '-' (hyphen).  One section ends when another section begins.  The following example gives an INI file with comments and sections in it.
<verbatim>
# Start of INI file
[SECTION1]
# Start of section named SECTION1
# End of section named SECTION1
[section-2]
# Start of section named section-2
</verbatim>

A property is a key value pair with the key being declared first followed be an '=' (equal) and then the value.  Keys should only include alphanumeric characters plus '.' (period), '_' (underscore), and '-' (hyphen) while values may include any visible ASCII character plus a space or tab.  Properties belong to the section in which they are declared.

The following example gives an INI file with comments, sections, and properties.
<verbatim>
# Start of INI file
[SECTION1]
# Start of section named SECTION1
prop1 = value1
prop2 = value2
# End of section named SECTION1
[section-2]
# Start of section named section-2
prop2 = value3
</verbatim>
