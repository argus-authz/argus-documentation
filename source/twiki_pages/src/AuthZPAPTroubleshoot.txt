---+!! Argus: Policy Administration Point (PAP): Troubleshooting


%TOC%

---+ Policies that use the =pfqan= attribute do not work properly (PAP v. 1.1)

PAP version 1.1 ships with a buggy configuration file that encodes policies that uses the =pfqan= attribute 
in a way that it's not understood by the PDP. This bug is tracked [[https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?72078][here]].
There is a quick workaround for this issue:

   * save your policies to a file 
   * remove all policies from the pap (pap-admin rap command).
   * shut down the pap service.
   * edit the /opt/argus/pap/conf/attribute-mappings.ini and substitue the line:
   <pre>pfqan.xacml-id = http://authz-interop.org/xacml/subject/voms-primary-fqan</pre> with this line:
   <pre>pfqan.xacml-id = http://glite.org/xacml/attribute/fqan/primary</pre>
   * start the pap service.
   * import the previously saved policies with the pap-admin apf command.
