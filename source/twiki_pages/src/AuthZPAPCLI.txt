---+!! Argus Policy Administration Point (PAP): Administration
%TOC%

The CLI (Command Line Interface) allows to perform all of the policy management operations as well as to set most of the configuration information of the PAP including authorization settings. All these operations are accessible by means of (sub)commands of the PAP CLI and they are divided in three sections: _policy management_, _pap management_ and _authorization management_. 

The command to invoke the CLI is =pap-admin=.

---++ Running the pap-admin client

Type:

<verbatim>pap-admin --help</verbatim>

to get a list of the commands supported by the current version of the PAP command line client.

The general usage is the following:
<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] <command> [options] [args]</verbatim>

   * =global-options= : are options shared by all commands (all these options are reported by =--help=).%BR%
   * =command= : the command to perform.%BR%
   * =options= : command specific options.%BR%

Type:
<verbatim>pap-admin <command> --help</verbatim>

to see the available command specific options.

Global options:
   * =-h,--help=: help message;
   * =-v,--verbose=: set verbose commands output;
   * =--host &lt;arg&gt;=: specifies the target PAP hostname (default is localhost). This option defines the PAP endpoint to be contacted as follows: https://arg:port/pap/services/;
   * =--port &lt;arg&gt;=: specifies the port on which the target PAP is listening (default is 8150);
   * =--url &lt;arg&gt;=: specifies the full target PAP endpoint (default: https://localhost:8150/pap/services/);
   * =--cert &lt;arg&gt;=: specifies non-standard user certificate;
   * =--key &lt;arg&gt;=: specifies non-standard user private key;
   * =--password &lt;arg&gt;=: specifies the password used to decrypt the user's private key;
   * =--proxy &lt;arg&gt;=: specifies a user proxy to be used for authentication;

By default, the =pap-admin= is configured to contact a PAP daemon on localhost port 8150 (i.e., the standalone PAP daemon). If you want to contact a PAP on another host use the =--host= option, a PAP listening on a different port use the =--port= option. Alternatively the full endpoint can be specified with the =--url= option.

*NOTE:* The Argus PDP caches the policy pulled from the PAP.  If you make policy changes to the PAP you will need to restart the PDP in order to force it to refresh its policy.  Also, the PEPd caches results from the PDP for a short time (up to 10 minutes, by default) so you may need to restart the PEPd as well.

---+++ Exit status
Each command returns 0 for success or non-zero in case of error.

---+++ X509 authentication 
A valid X509 certificate or proxy certificate is needed in order to run the =pap-admin= client. The certificate to be used by the command is found as follows:

   1. if the user is _root_ then the client looks for host certificate at the usual location, i.e. =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem=. These locations can be overridden by setting the =X509_USER_CERT= and =X509_USER_KEY= environment variables.
   2. if the user is not _root_, then the client looks for a proxy certificate at the usual location, i.e., =/tmp/x509up_u%GREEN%&lt;uid&gt;%ENDCOLOR%=.  The default proxy location can be overridden using the =X509_USER_PROXY= environment variable. If no proxy is found, then  the client looks for a certificate (and the relative private key) at the usual location, i.e., =$HOME/.globus/usercert.pem= and =$HOME/.globus/userkey.pem=. These locations can be overriden by setting the =X509_USER_CERT= and =X509_USER_KEY= environment variables.
 
This behaviour can be overridden by specifying the =--cert=, =--key= and =--proxy= command line options.

---+++ Client configuration (since version 1.3.0)

The =pap-admin.properties= file, found in =/etc/argus/pap= (EMI) or =/opt/argus/pap/conf= (gLite), allows to set the following properties:

| *Property* | *Description* | *Default Value* |
| host| The PAP host that will be contacted by the pap-admin CLI  if no host is explicitly specified with the =--host= option  | localhost |
| port | The remote PAP service port number | 8150 |

This property file is expecially useful when administering a PAP installed on a remote machine.  

---++ Policy Management Commands

This set of commands allows to perform policy management operations. All the commands in this section modifies the _default_ pap. In order to target another local pap use the option =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=.

---+++ Command: list-policies
List policies. By default the policies of the _default_ pap are listed unless option =--pap= is specified.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] list-policies [options]</verbatim>

Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: list policies of pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);
   * =--all=: list policies of all the defined paps;
   * =-srai,--show-ra-ids=: show resource and action ids;
   * =-sai,--show-all-ids=: show all ids (resource, action and rule ids);
   * =--show-xacml=: print policies using XACML.

---+++ Command: ban
Allows to ban an attribute (i.e. SUBJECT, FQAN, CA, etc.).

A _deny_ rule is added for the given attribute into the specified resource/action value. If the resource or the action values are not specified then ".*" is assumed.

<verbatim>usage:  pap-admin [global-options] ban [options] <id> <value></verbatim>

   * =id=: id of the attribute. The list of supported id depends on the Argus version:
      * Argus v. 1.0: dn, ca, vo, fqan, pfqan.
      * Argus v. 1.1: subject, subject-issuer, vo, fqan, pfqan.

   * =value=: value of the attribute - *note:* If you are using Argus v. 1.0, the DN must be in RFC2253 format, which can be obtained from =openssl= using the command =openssl x509 -in <cert.pem> -noout -subject -nameopt rfc2253=

Command specific options:
   * =-a,--action &lt;value&gt;=: specify an action value (default is ".*")
   * =-r,--resource &lt;value&gt;=: specify a resource value (default is ".*")
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: add the policy to the pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing)
   * =--private=: set the policy as private
   * =--public=: set the policy as public

*Semantic of the command*: the _resource_ and the _action_ where the deny rule is inserted are chosen as follows:
   * if the first resource found in the repository matches the given one, then that resource is used, otherwise a new one is created.
   * if a matching resource was found, then if its first action matches the given one then this action is used, otherwise a new action is created (i.e. inside the new resource or inside the matched resource).
   * otherwise a new resource/action are created and inserted on the top.

Example:
<verbatim>pap-admin ban subject "CN=host.test.foo.it, L=FOO, OU=Host, O=ORGANIZATION, C=IT"</verbatim>

---+++ Command: un-ban
Allows to un-ban an attribute (i.e. SUBJECT, FQAN, CA, etc.), that means removing a =deny= rule (if it exists in the given resource/action) for the given attribute.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] un-ban [options] <id> <value></verbatim>

   * =id=: id of the attribute. The list of supported id depends on the Argus version:
      * Argus v. 1.0: dn, ca, vo, fqan, pfqan.
      * Argus v. 1.1: subject, subject-issuer, vo, fqan, pfqan.

   * =value=: value of the attribute  - *note:* If you are using Argus v. 1.0, the DN must be in RFC2253 format, which can be obtained from =openssl= using the command =openssl x509 -in <cert.pem> -noout -subject -nameopt rfc2253=

Command specific options:
   * =-a,--action &lt;value&gt;=: specify an action value (default is ".*")
   * =-r,--resource &lt;value&gt;=: specify a resource value (default is ".*")
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: remove the ban policy from the pap _alias_ ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing)

*Semantic of the command*: the target _resource_ and _action_ to search the deny rule for are chosen as follows:
   * the target _resource_ is the first matching _resource_ in the repository;
   * inside the target _resource_ the target _action_ is the first matching _action_ ;
   * if no target _resource_ or _action_ were found than the result is an error message saying "ban policy not found".

Example:
<verbatim>pap-admin un-ban subject "CN=host.test.foo.it, L=FOO, OU=Host, O=ORGANIZATION, C=IT"</verbatim>

---+++ Command: add-policy
Add a permit/deny policy.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] add-policy [options] <permit|deny> <id=value>...</verbatim>

   * =permit|deny=: effect of the policy.
   * =id=value=: a string in the form "<id>=<value>", where _id_ is any of the attribute ids that can be specified in the simplified policy language and _value_ the value to be assigned (e.g. fqan=/vo/group).

Required command options:
   1 =--action-id &lt;action-id&gt;= optionally with =--rule-id &lt;rule-id&gt;=: allows to specify an action-id to insert the policy into.
   1 =--resource &lt;value&gt;= and =--action &lt;value&gt;=: allows to specify a resource/action value to insert the policy into.

The two groups (1 and 2) of required options are mutually exclusive.

This command allows to add a (permit/deny) rule into an action by specifying an action-id (in this case the action must already exist) or a resource/action value. In the latter case a new resource and/or action are created if they don't already exist. The command returns an error if there are more than one existing resource and/or action with the same value. By default the rule is inserted at the top of an action unless the =--bottom= option is given. If the =--rule-id= is set the rule is inserted before the given rule-id or after if the =--after= option is present.

Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: add the policy to the pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);
   * =--action-id &lt;action-id&gt;=: specify an action id;
   * =--rule-id &lt;rule-id&gt;=: specify a rule id (requires option =--action-id=);
   * =--resource &lt;value&gt;=: specify a resource value;
   * =--action &lt;value&gt;=: specify an action value;
   * =--after=: insert the rule after the given rule id;
   * =--bottom=: insert the rule at the bottom of the list of rules of the action.
   * =--obligation= =&lt;obligationId&gt;=: specify an obligation.  (*since version 1.2.0*)
   * =--obligation-scope=  =&lt;scope&gt;=: Defines in which scope the obligation will be defined. Possible values: =action=, =resource=. If not specified, =resource= is used as default. (*since version 1.2.0*)


---+++ Command: add-policies-from-file
Add policies (resources or actions) defined in the given file.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] add-policies-from-file [options] <file> [resourceId]</verbatim>

   * =file=: text file containing the policies to add (policies defined with the simplified policy language)
   * =resourceId=: the _resource_ to insert the policies into.

If _resourceId_ is not specified then _file_ must contain _resource_ elements that will be added, by default, at the bottom (unless option =--pivot= is specified). Otherwise if _resourceId_ is not specified then _file_ must contain _action_ elements that will be added, by default, at the bottom inside _resourceId_ (unless option =--pivot= is specified).

Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: add the policies to the pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);
   * =--pivot &lt;id&gt;=: insert before <id>;
   * =--after=: modifies the behavior of the =--pivot= option in insert after <id>.

---+++ Command: update-policy-from-file
Update a resource/action with a new resource/action defined in a given file.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] update-policy-from-file [options] <id> <file></verbatim>

   * =id=: id, as listed by the command =pap-admin lp --show-all-ids= command, of the resource or action to be updated;
   * =file=: text file containing the new policy definition (using the simplified policy language syntax).

In order to modify an action the =file= must contain only the new action, for example:
<verbatim>action ".*" {
    rule deny { subject="/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic  Units/OU=Users/CN=user/CN=111111/CN=user name" }
} 
</verbatim>


Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: update the policies for pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);

---+++ Command: remove-policy
Remove policy by id.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] remove-policy [options] id...</verbatim>

   * =id=: id, as listed by the command =pap-admin lp --show-all-ids= command, of the policy (resource, action or rule) to remove;

Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: remove policies of pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);

---+++ Command: remove-all-policies
Remove all policies of a pap. Use option =--pap= to specify a pap different than the default one.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] remove-all-policies [options]</verbatim>

Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: remove the policies of pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);

---+++ Command: move
Move a resource, action or rule before or after another, respectively, resource, action or rule.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] move [options] <id> <pivotId></verbatim>

   * =id=: id, as listed by the command =pap-admin lp --show-all-ids= command, of the policy (resource, action or rule) to move;
   * =pivotId=: id of the pivot policy ( _id_ is moved before _pivotId_)

If _id_ refers to a resource, action or rule then _pivotId_ must be, respectively, a resource, action or rule id.

Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: move the policy of pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);
   * =--after=: move _id_ after _pivotId_.


---+++ Command: add-obligation (*since version 1.2.0*)
Adds on obligation to an existing resource or action policy.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] add-obligation <policyId> <obligationId></verbatim>

   * =policyId=: the id of the policy where the obligation is to be added. In order the get the policyId of existing policies, run the =list-policies= command with the =--show-all-ids= option.
   * =obligationId=: the id of the obligation that will be added.


Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: add on policies defined in the pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);


---+++ Command: remove-obligation (*since version 1.2.0*)
Removes an obligation from an existing resource or action policy.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] remove-obligation <policyId> <obligationId></verbatim>

   * =policyId=: the id of the policy where the obligation is to be removed. In order the get the policyId of existing policies, run the =list-policies= command with the =--show-all-ids= option.
   * =obligationId=: the id of the obligation that will be removed.


Command specific options:
   * =--pap &lt;alias&gt;=: add on policies defined in the pap "alias" ( _default_ pap is assumed if this option is missing);



---++ PAP Management Commands
This set of commands allows to perform management operations of the PAPs.

---+++ Command: ping
Ping a PAP and return version information.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] ping</verbatim>

---+++ Command: add-pap
Add a remote or local pap.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] add-pap [options] <alias> [<endpoint> <dn>]</verbatim>

   * =alias=: a friendly (unique) name used to identify the pap
   * =endpoint=: endpoint of the remote pap in the form: <verbatim>[<protocol>://]<host>:[<port>/[path]]</verbatim>
   * =dn=: DN of the remote pap

A just added pap is disabled by default (its policies are not sent to the PDP), use the command =enable-pap= to enable it (see [[#Command_enable_pap]]). 

By default a pap is considered to be private (use the =--public= option to set the pap as public). 
Policies defined in a public pap can be fetched from other remote PAPs, while this is not allowed when the PAP is set to private.

If =endpoint= and =dn= are present the pap is considered to be remote (unless option =--local= is specified), otherwise it is local. For the endpoint the only required parameter is the hostname, these are the default values:
   * _protocol_: https
   * _port_: 8150
   * _service path_: pap/services

When a new pap is added, the PAP service tries immediately to fetch its policies. If the remote pap is not reachable, the pap-admin command prints 
an error message clarifying that the pap was successfully added, but the fetching of the policies failed.

If the option =--no-policies= is given, the policies are not fetched at pap creation time but automatically by the server every =polling interval= seconds or manually when the a =refresh-cache= command is sent to the server.

Examples of endpoint are:
   * =test.site.com= (hostname);
   * =test.site.com:9999= (hostname and port);
   * =test.site.com:9999/service_path= (hostname, port, and service path);
   * =https://test.site.com:9999/service_path= (full URL).

Command specific options:
   * =-l,--local=: set the pap as local;
   * =--remote=: set the pap as remote;
   * =--private=: set the pap as private;
   * =--public=: set the pap as public;
   * =--no-policies=: do not fetch the policies now.

Example:
<verbatim>pap-admin add-pap cnaf_pap test.cnaf.infn.it "/C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Host/L=CNAF/CN=test.cnaf.infn.it"</verbatim>

---+++ Command: update-pap
Update pap information.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] update-pap [options] <alias> [<endpoint> <dn>]</verbatim>

The input is the same as for the "add-pap" command, the effect is to update old information with the new one. The _alias_ of a pap cannot be modified. In the case of a remote pap the policies are fetched immediately unless option =--no-policies= is given.

---+++ Command: remove-pap
Remove a pap and delete its policies.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] remove-pap <alias></verbatim>

   * =alias=: alias of the pap to remove

---+++ Command: list-paps
List all defined paps.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] list-paps [options]</verbatim>

Command specific options:
   * =-l=: use a long list format (displays all the information of a pap).

---+++ Command: enable-pap
Set a pap as enabled (i.e. PDPs will get its policies).

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] enable-pap <alias></verbatim>

---+++ Command: disable-pap
Set a pap as disabled (i.e. PDPs won't get its policies).

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] disable-pap <alias></verbatim>

---+++ Command: get-paps-order
Get paps ordering.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] get-paps-order</verbatim>

If no ordering is defined the output message is: =No ordering has been defined=. If the _default_ pap is not listed in the ordering (like in the no ordering defined case) by default it is placed for first.

---+++ Command: set-paps-order
Define paps ordering.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] set-paps-order [alias]...</verbatim>

   * =alias=: a valid pap alias.

All the aliases must be valid (existing). If no arguments are given then the current ordering (if there's any defined) is deleted.

Example:%BR% The remote pap _osct_ contains banning policies and we want that policies to be evaluated for first. This is command to issue:
<verbatim>pap-admin set-paps-order osct default</verbatim>

If the PAP service contains other paps beyond the _osct_, then their policies are evaluated after the _osct_ and _default_ pap policies. Since the ordering contains only the _osct_ and the _default_ paps it is not guaranteed a special order for the evaluation of the policies of all the other paps (except that they are evaluated after these two paps).

---+++ Command: refresh-cache
Invalidates the local policy cache and retrieves policies from remote paps.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] refresh-cache [alias]...</verbatim>

   * =alias=: a valid pap alias.

The arguments identify the paps that will be contacted. If no arguments are given, all the defined remote paps are contacted.

---+++ Command:  get-polling-interval
Get the polling interval in seconds.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] get-polling-interval</verbatim>

---+++ Command: set-polling-interval
Invalidates the local policy cache and retrieves policies from remote paps.

<verbatim>usage: pap-admin [global-options] set-polling-interval <seconds> </verbatim>

   * =seconds=: polling interval in seconds.

---++ Authorization Management Commands

This set of commands implement Access Control List (ACL) management for PAP administrators.

---+++ Command: list-acl

The =list-acl= command provides an easy way of knowing the authorization configuration of a running PAP.

Typing:
<verbatim>
pap-admin list-acl
</verbatim>

prints out the Access Control Entries (ACEs) comprising the ACL currently defined for the running PAP.

Example:
<verbatim>
~# pap-admin list-acl

/voms-ws/Role=PAP-Admin :
   POLICY_READ_LOCAL|POLICY_READ_REMOTE|POLICY_WRITE|CONFIGURATION_READ|CONFIGURATION_WRITE

"/C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Personal Certificate/L=CNAF/CN=Andrea Ceccanti" :
   POLICY_READ_LOCAL|POLICY_READ_REMOTE|POLICY_WRITE|CONFIGURATION_READ|CONFIGURATION_WRITE

ANYONE :
   CONFIGURATION_READ|CONFIGURATION_WRITE
</verbatim>

Required permissions : =CONFIGURATION_READ=.

---+++ Command: add-ace

The =add-ace= command allows to add (or change) an ACE to the PAP ACL. Note that if an ACE entry already exists on the server for the principal specified in the command, the permissions in such ACE are *replaced* by the ones specified in the command.

Usage:
<verbatim>
pap-admin add-ace <principal> <permissions>
</verbatim>

where:

   * =principal= can be either an X509 DN or a VOMS FQAN. =ANYONE= can be used to assign permissions to any authenticated user.
   * =permissions= is a | separated list of PAP permissions that will be assigned to =principal=. The =ALL= shortcut can be used to assign all permission. Valid permissions values are defined [[#PAP_permissions][here]].

Example:
<verbatim>
pap add-ace '/atlas/Role=VO-Admin' 'ALL'
</verbatim>

Required permissions: =CONFIGURATION_READ|CONFIGURATION_WRITE=

---+++ Command: remove-ace

The =remove-ace= command removes an ACE from the PAP ACL.

Usage:
<verbatim>
pap-admin remove-ace <principal>
</verbatim>

where:

   * =principal= can be either an X509 DN or a VOMS FQAN. =ANYONE= can be used to remove permissions assigned to any authenticated user.

Example:
<verbatim>
pap remove-ace '/atlas/Role=VO-Admin'
</verbatim>

Required permissions: =CONFIGURATION_READ|CONFIGURATION_WRITE=
