---+!! Argus PEP Server Obligation Handlers
%TOC%

Obligation handlers are plugins used by the authorization service in order to adjust the environment, under which an action will run, to a state that meets a particular set of obligations.  Obligation are things like "write output to directory X" or "perform all work as user 1".

---++ Grid Map POSIX Account Mapping Obligation Handler

*NOTE: The Grid Map Account Mapping Obligation Handler only works with the  [[AuthZPEPPIP#gLite_Grid_Authorization_Profile][gLite Grid Authorization Profile PIP]], or with clients implementing the  [[https://edms.cern.ch/document/1058175][XACML Grid Worker Node Authorization Profile (v.1.0)]] or the [[https://edms.cern.ch/document/1078881][XACML Grid Computing Element Authorization Profile (v.1.0)]] specifications.*

This obligation handler maps a subject ID, given as a DN, and set of FQANs, for example those provided by the [[AuthZPEPPIP#gLite_Grid_Authorization_Profile][gLite Grid Authorization Profile PIP]], in to a POSIX account (login name, primary group name and secondary group names).  

This mapping is controlled by two [[AuthZMapFile][grid map files]], one that provides the mapping of the subject to an account indicator (login name or pool account indicatior) and one that maps the subject to a set of group names (one primary and any number of secondary).


---+++ Configuration
   1. Create the account and group [[AuthZMapFile][mapping files]] appropriate for your environment
   1. Create a new [[AuthZINIFile][INI section]] for your handler (you may choose any valid INI section name)
   1. To handler INI section add the =parserClass= property with the value =org.glite.authz.pep.obligation.dfpmap.DFPMObligationHandlerConfigurationParser=
   1. Define at least the required ( =accountMapFile=, =groupMapFile=, =gridMapDir=) and any optional configuration properties for this handler

---++++!! OH Configuration Properties

*NOTE: the default =preferDNForLoginName= property value was _false_ for Argus 1.0 and Argus 1.1. From Argus 1.2 the default is _true_.*

---+++ Required Response Obligation Trigger
This obligation handler is triggered if the PDP response contains the obligation =http://glite.org/xacml/obligation/local-environment-map=, or the value defined by the _handledObligationId_ parameter.

---+++ Required Request Attributes
This obligation handler *requires* the following request attributes in order to correctly map the user. The attributes can be provided by the [[AuthZPEPPIP#gLite_Grid_Authorization_Profile][gLite Grid Authorization Profile PIP]], or directly by the clients implementing the [[https://edms.cern.ch/document/1058175][XACML Grid Worker Node Authorization Profile (v.1.0)]] or the [[https://edms.cern.ch/document/1078881][XACML Grid Computing Element Authorization Profile (v.1.0)]] specifications.

   * The Subject Identifier
      * *type:* Subject
      * *id:* urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject:subject-id
      * *data type:* urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:data-type:x500Name
      * *multiple values allowed:* no
      * *description:* This is the Subject DN as given in the end-entity certificate.  It is in RFC2253 format.

   * The VOMS Primary FQAN
      * *type:* Subject
      * *id:* !http://glite.org/xacml/attribute/fqan/primary
      * *data type:* !http://glite.org/xacml/datatype/fqan

   * The VOMS FQANs
      * *type:* Subject
      * *id:* !http://glite.org/xacml/attribute/fqan
      * *data type:* !http://glite.org/xacml/datatype/fqan
      * *multiple values allowed:* yes
      * *description:* All the Fully Qualified Attribute Name (FQAN)s for the subject

---+++ Response Obligation Results
This result of this obligation handler is the *replacement* of the generic =http://glite.org/xacml/obligation/local-environment-map= with the more specific obligation =http://glite.org/xacml/obligation/local-environment-map/posix=.  

This later obligation carries the account and group names in the following attribute assignments:
   * one =http://glite.org/attribute/xacml/user-id= account login name
   * zero or one =http://glite.org/attribute/xacml/group-id/primary= primary group name
   * zero or more =http://glite.org/xacml/attribute/group-id= secondary group names

---++++!! Example Configuration
This is an example PEPd configuration file with one gridmap POSIX account mapping obligation handler defined:
<verbatim>
[SERVICE]
entityId = http://argus.example.org/pep
hostname = argus.example.org
obligationHandlers = ACCOUNT_MAPPING_OH

[PDP]
pdps = https://argus.example.org:8152/authz

[ACCOUNT_MAPPING_OH]
parserClass = org.glite.authz.pep.obligation.dfpmap.DFPMObligationHandlerConfigurationParser
accountMapFile = /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
groupMapFile = /etc/grid-security/group-mapfile
gridMapDir = /etc/grid-security/gridmapdir
</verbatim>

---+++ Account and Group Mapping
This Obligation Handler uses the following logic to determine the mapping of the subject to a POSIX account.

---+++++!! Preconditions
   * The input to this process is the subject DN of the end-entity certificate of the user and optionally a primary FQAN and a list of secondary FQANs.
   * When dealing with the account map file (the gridmap file) and the group map file, entries are evaluated in the order listed in the file.  Once a match is found processing stops.
   * The grid map directory is populated with information for all configured pool accounts on the system.  A pool account is considered "configured" if there is a zero-byte file, whose name is the pool account name, in the grid map directory.  The grid map directory must also be read/writable by the user running the authorization service.

---+++++!!Mapping Steps
   1. If a primary FQAN is given it is checked against the mappings listed in the account map file.  If the primary FQAN matches a key in the map file then the associated value provides the account indicator.
   1. If no account indicator was determined by means of the primary FQAN the subject DN is checked against the mappings listed in the account map file.  If the DN matches a key in the map file then the associated value provides the account indicator.  If no match is found processing stops and no map is available.
   1. If the account indicator starts with a period ('.'), its value, without the period, is considered to be a pool account name prefix.  If the account indicator does not start with a period it is a POSIX account name.  If no account indicator was determined the mapping process fails.
   1. If a primary FQAN is given then it is evaluated against entries in a group map file.  The first entry that matches determines the primary group name.  If no match is found, the mapping process fails.
   1. If one or more secondary FQANs are given then each one is matched against the group map file and each match determines a secondary group name.  If no matches occur then there are no secondary group names associated with the account.
   1. If  the account indicator is a POSIX account name, and zero or one primary group and zero or more secondary group names were determined then the mapping is completed.  The user is mapped to that account.
   1. If the account indicator is a pool account name prefix a lookup in the grid map directory occurs.  The file looked for is generated according to the template =encoded_dn{:primary_group_name{:secondary_group_name}*}?= with the secondary group names listed in ascending alphabetical order.
   1. If the file exists and has a link count of 2 then the hard link is followed to a file whose name is used as the POSIX account name.  The last modified time of the two files is updated to the current time.  If the link count is not 2 or the POSIX account name does not start with the account name prefix, the mapping process fails.
   1. If the file does not exist, a list of files, within the grid map directory, matching the pool account name prefix followed exclusively by one or more numeric digits, is retrieved.  An example regular expression representation of this would be =prod[0-9]+=
   1. This list of files is searched for a file whose link count is 1, this is a candidate pool account file.  A hard link to the pool account file, whose name corresponds to the filled in template described above is then created.  If no such pool account file is found the mapping process fails.
   1. The pool account file link count is rechecked, if it is more than 2 (indicating another request mapped to that same file at the same time) the created link is removed and the mapping process reverts to the previous step.
   1. If the link count is 2 the mapping is complete.  The user is mapped to the pool account corresponding to the given file.

*Note:* In the case where no FQANs are available, this obligation handler only returns a login name.  No group information is returned.

---+++++!! DN Encoding Rules
   1. Leading zeros are removed from attribute types that are encoded as dotted decimal OIDs
   1. !DirectoryString attribute values of type !PrintableString and !UTF8String are not output in hexadecimal format
   1. !DirectoryString attribute values of types other than !PrintableString and !UTF8String are output in hexadecimal format
   1. Leading and trailing white space characters are removed from non-hexadecimal attribute values (unless the value consists entirely of white space characters)
   1. Internal substrings of one or more white space characters are converted to a single space in non-hexadecimal attribute values
   1. Relative Distinguished Names containing more than one Attribute Value Assertion (AVA) are output in the following order: an alphabetical ordering of AVAs containing standard keywords, followed by a numeric ordering of AVAs containing OID keywords.
   1. The only characters in attribute values that are escaped are those which section 2.4 of RFC 2253 states must be escaped (they are escaped using a preceding backslash character)
   1. The entire name is converted to upper case using US localization
   1. The entire name is converted to lower case using US localization
   1. The name is finally normalized using normalization form KD, as described in the Unicode Standard and UAX #15
   1. The DN is converted to the non-standard, openssl one line format
   1. The string is then URL-encoded

---+++++!! Be Aware
   * A reorder of entries in the group map file that results in a change in the primary group will cause an incoming user to be mapped to a new account as this information is part of the link created in the grid map directory.
   * A reordering of entries in the group map file that does *not* result in a change to the primary group but provides the same secondary groups in a different order does *not* result in a new mapping for a returning user since the link created in the grid map directory orders the secondary group names in ascending alphabetical order.
