   * VOMS upgraded to version 3.1
   * CANL upgraded to version 2.2.0
   * OpenSAML upgraded to version 2.6.4

Packages

Service configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instructions on how to configure and run the services are provided in the
following documentation sections:

- :ref:`Manual configuration <argus-manual-configuration>`
- :ref:`YAIM configuration  <configuration-with-yaim>`

Configuration for the services has not changed, so existing SL6 installation
can upgrade and reconfigure services as usual (YAIM on SL6 is still supported).

YAIM configuration support is **not** provided on CENTOS 7; sites are free to use
their favourite configuration management tool (Ansible, Puppet, Quattor) to
manage the Argus services.

Changes in the mapping logic behaviour (`pep-7`_ , `pep-11`_), and in
particular in the handling of secondary group names, could produce different
mappings for user jobs, so it's safer to drain the site before upgrading the
Argus services to version 1.7.0 if you want to avoid potential job failures
due to the upgrade. More details can be found :ref:`here <argus_mapping>`.

Note (added 2017-07-19):

If needed, to keep compatibility with the LCMAPS "-do_not_use_secondary_gids"
option used by the CREAM YAIM module, in Argus 1.7 you would need to add:

useSecondaryGroupNamesForMapping = false

in the [ACCOUNTMAP_OH] section of the /etc/argus/pepd/pepd.ini
and restart the service.
