Upgrade procedure
-----------------

Argus 1.7.1 is a drop-in replacement for 1.7.0.
To install the new version and obtain a system with the same behavior of the previous release:

#. Install the new packages: ``yum update``.
#. Reconfigure, manually or with a configuration management system such as Puppet or Ansible;
#. Restart the services.

The new release provides a default configuration that grants the
access to resources only granted to certificates issued by CAs in the *classic*,
*slcs* and *mics* IGTF profiles.

To enable IOTA CA support for selected VOs, youâ€™ll need to:

#. Install the IOTA CA RPM.
#. Install another, yet-to-be-named RPM providing a VO-CA-AP policy file which states
   which authentication profiles are enabled for VOs and trusted certificates.
#. Configure the Argus PEP server to point the VO-CA-AP policy file, setting the
   ``authenticationProfilePolicyFile`` property int the ``AUTHN_PROFILE_PIP`` section
   with the ``vo-ca-ap-file`` absolute path.

   For example:

   ``authenticationProfilePolicyFile = /etc/grid-security/vo-ca-ap-file``
